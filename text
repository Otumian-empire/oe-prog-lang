Creating a programming language or compiler

We will de-sugar the syntax of javascript and python and parser tongue

Learn parser tongue and racket.

define data structures than syntax

define an arithmetic expressions. 
Most operators a binary operators which takes operands where an operand
can be a number or another operand

(define-type ArithC
    [num (n number?)]
    [plus (l ArithC?) (r ArithC)]
    [mult ((l ArithC?) (r ArithC)])

Assuming we write up and expression, the operands can be either an operation: plus
or mult and, a number.

(define (interp e)
    (type-case ArithC e
        [num (n) n]
        [plus (l r) (+ (interp l) 
                        (interp r))]

        [mult (l r) (* (interp l) 
                        (interp r))]))





We will have to define num, mult and plus
